<h1>ðŸ’½ Spotify multi-disc player</h1>
<p>When I was a kid my primary means of listening to music was through my dad's CD collection. At the time, my family had a CD player that allowed you to put in three discs and shuffle their respective tracklists together.</p>
<p>Today, I listen to my music on Spotify, and should I want to shuffle three albums together while I work, or relax, I need to add all three to a new playlist. I don't particularly like the clutter of having random playlists all over my Spotify, and further think it silly to need to create then delete a playlist to imitate a function that was the default for an archaic piece of technology â€“ so I took a day to build a web app that mimics the functionality I was missing.</p>
